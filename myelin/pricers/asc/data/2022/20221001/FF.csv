Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) determine whether a drug, device, procedure, or other service meets all program requirements for coverage. For example, MACs determine that it is reasonable and necessary to treat the beneficiary’s condition and whether it is excluded from payment.",,,,,,,

"NOTE 1: CY 2022 final OPPS payment rate and CY 2022 final device offset percentage are based on results from our ASC standard ratesetting methodology. However, for procedures assigned to a designated low volume APC where the ASC payment rate would otherwise exceed the payment rate under the OPPS C-APC methodology, the OPPS payment rate under the ASC standard ratesetting methodology is recalculated for the procedure to hold the ASC payment rate equal to the OPPS payment rate and the device offset percentage unchanged.",,,,,,,

For non device-intensive procedures, the CY 2022 final device portion is calculated by multiplying the CY 2022 final device offset percentage (Column G) by the CY 2022 final ASC payment rate shown in Addendum AA.

"NOTE 1: CY 2024 final OPPS payment rate and CY 2024 final device offset percentage are based on results from our ASC standard ratesetting methodology. However, for procedures assigned to a designated low volume APC where the ASC payment rate would otherwise exceed the payment rate under the OPPS C-APC methodology, the OPPS payment rate under the ASC standard ratesetting methodology is recalculated for the procedure to hold the ASC payment rate equal to the OPPS payment rate and the device offset percentage unchanged.",,,,,,,

"NOTE 2:  For device-intensive procedures (PI=J8), the CY 2024 final device portion (Column H) is calculated by multiplying the CY 2024 final device offset percentage (Column G) by the CY 2024 final OPPS payment rate (Column F). For non device-intensive procedures, the CY 2024 final device portion is calculated by multiplying the CY 2024 final device offset percentage (Column G) by the CY 2024 final ASC payment rate shown in Addendum AA. Additionally, for device-intensive and non device-intensive procedures, unless otherwise specified, the device portion is the associated device offset amount when billing device pass-through categories.",,,,,,,

These preventive services are identified with a double asterisk (**).,,,,,,,
